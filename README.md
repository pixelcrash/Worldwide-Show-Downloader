# Gilles Peterson / Worldwide Show Downloader

This is a little nodejs app, which runs in the MAC OSX terminal and downloads 
the latest Worldwide Show from BBC Radio 6. The app uses **get_iplayer** 

You can install the **get_iplayer** with brew in terminal

```$ brew install get_iplayer```

Choose a folder where you want to save your music files and install the node app via

```$ git clone github.com:pixelcrash/worldwideshow.git```

To download the latest show you simply have to run the app 

```$ node worldwide.js```

The download will take some time, be patient. It will try to get the file with the best audio quality 

After the download is done, you will have a *.m4a audio file with the correct filename and cover image.

Just run this command every week to never miss a show
